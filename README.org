* Git Load

Load git repositories as packages.

** Installation
   If you're hooked up to [[http://melpa.org/][MELPA]] (as of 6-24-2016 this package is not in MELPA yet):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET git-load
#END_EXAMPLE

Alternatively

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(unless (git-repo? "~/.emacs.d/git/git-load")
  (progn
    (let ((git-repo "~/.emacs.d/git/"))
      (git-clone "https://github.com/k0hax/git-load.git"))))
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/git/git-load")
(load "git-load")
#+END_SRC

** Usage

   The original reason I wrote this code is because MELPA's version of helm-spotify was out of date, and I wanted to test a new version.
   Here's an example of how to do that.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (eval-after-load "git-load"
     (git-load "https://github.com/pschorf/helm-spotify.git" "helm-spotify"))
   #+END_SRC

** Advanced usage

   If you would like to change the git directory, which is =~/.emacs.d/git/= by default. You may change =git-load-default-directory=
